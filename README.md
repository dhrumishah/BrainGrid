## Deployed Link
- [https://brain-grid.vercel.app/](https://brain-grid.vercel.app/)

## Project Description
- It is a full stack platform where a user can attempt coding questions, it also has a Javascript compiler where you can submit your code for the given coding problems.
- I have integrated the code mirror library for the code editor and have also added the functionality of verifying the correctness of the submitted code by using the Chai library.
- The questions in the website come from a pre-built API that has the problems, descriptions, and example test cases.
- The tech stack used is NextJS, Tailwind, and Firebase for the backend, and libraries like code mirror, chai. I have also added the authentication and feature to like and dislike the questions.

Major features: authentication, feature of liking, disliking and starring the questions, full screen mode for question solving, local storage for the code submission, celebration animation on submitting the solutions
